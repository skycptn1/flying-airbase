                <h2>The First Candy</h2>
                <p>
                    This little fruity Jujubes candy is a staple at movie theaters and is available in vending
                    machines
                    and candy stores all over the US. These simple little snacks are delightfully chewy and brightly
                    colored ad they have not changed much since the first years that they were sold. There are
                    indications that this candy has been made since 1709 and that the recipe has not changed much
                    since
                    then.
                </p>

                <h2>1709</h2>
                <p>As mentioned, these cute little candies
                    have been around since 1709. At the time, this candy was
                    made with gum Arabic, sugar, and a date-like fruit that was called the jujube fruit. This is
                    where the candy got its name and the moniker has remained ever since, even after its
                    introduction in the US

                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="image image2" style="background-image: url(img/ju\ ju\ drops.jpg)">
                <h2>1853</h2>
                <p>In 1853, these candies were being sold as Ju Ju Paste and Ju Ju Drops but were basically the
                    same candy as the original. Along the way, Jujube-style candies have been flavored in many
                    ways, but many of these flavors have been fruity in nature.

                <h2>1920</h2>
                <p>Jujubes came to the US in the 1920s. The original flavors in the US were lilac, violet,
                    rose, lemon, and spearmint. The company that made them was called Heide. They invented
                    their own recipe for this tasty little candy and they sold them with great success.

                <h2>1995</h2>
                <p>Hersheyâ€™s bought the candy company in 1995 and took over the production of Jujubes.
                    The original flavors were abandoned overtime for the classic cherry, lemon, lime,
                    orange, and licorice collection.
