    <h1>Rylenors last stand</h1>

    <p>Amidst the desolate soil
        We heard the repeating cries of a fragment of metal
        So, true to Magnus' orders
        I take my company's reins onto the surface, we settle
        And as we branch out and explore the wreckage
        We uncover a terminal's long-lost message
        A visage of the past and of beautiful cities
        So what has occurred here? What are we missing?</p>

    <p>There is something wrong here and there is something hidden
        With every second growing closer, I feel it near me!</p>

    <p> <span class="psychic"> My mind shudders, why does my heart race?
            A psychic scream, like a crushing weight
            Resounding in every corner of the world
            "The Ancient awaits!"</span>
        Enwrapped in grief and beset by pain
        It bides it's time, all it does is wait
        We shoulder the hardship now and we endure
        And to its source, we'll trace</p>

    <p>The sight before my eyes is stark
        A Dreadnought here, bearing the Emperor's Children's mark?
        Unexpectedly, it interjects with pointed thoughts
        Awake once more, energy arcs
        Across its words now, demanding to know
        Are we standing here gathered as friend or foe?
        Its shattered form yet still poses a threat to us all
        It shall not be deceived, nor ignored</p>

    <p>I speak in half-truths to not invite alarm
        <span class="rylenor"> "I see through your words, and I am not disarmed
            We had learned from Him to hold to truth with every breath"</span>
        The wrong word here may mean death
        <span class="rylenor">"Even your words may be twisted and turned into weapons"</span>
        There is danger here, with every phrase now it beckons
        I know the name of he who has me in his sights<span class="rylenor">"I am he who remembers, the Ancient of
            Rites!"</span>
    </p>

    <p>All at once, the pieces come together in my mind
        This place was <span class="istvann"> Istvaan III </span>
        And we are here upon its corpse
        On the grave that was left behind!</p>

    <p><span class="rylenor">"Would you convince yourself I am a remnant seeking saving?
            This was not a cry for help!
            This was a lure I laid to invite something in need of slaying"</span></p>

    <p><span class="fulgrim">"Was this trap set for me, old one of mine?
            You look terrible, a disgrace, even"</span>
        <span class="rylenor">"At last, Fulgrim, you have come to me, abomination"</span>
        <span class="fulgrim">"Words uttered by a shattered pile of metal, rust and stagnation?
            You've had millennia to think of what to tell me, you've my attention"</span>
        <span class="rylenor">"I need not glory nor for words to speak
            When I have held
            "</span> <span class="virus_bomb">A Virus Bomb!</span>

        <span class="magic"> No!</span>
    </p>

    <p>Reaching out
        My Raptorae uses his mind to hold the pace, to silence time
        I channel him all of the strength I have
        His power desperately relying on mine
        And from my peripheral sight
        I can no longer see that frail shell, devoid of its might
        But rather a righteous being of defiance
        Who is not without the will to fight!</p>

    <p>I watch the Dreadnought lash out in wrath
        His blows deflected away from their path
        Despite the years he has endured
        It's clear that he will live, and he will die by the sword
        Fulgrim then returned a strike
        His sword slitting through bravado and machine alike
        His face a mix of contempt and glee
        The eyes of one who can feed off misery!</p>

    <p><span class="rylenor"> "You can never be forgiven for the things that you've done
            And so it falls to my hands to end the prodigal son!"</span>
        <span class="fulgrim"> "You cannot imagine the beautiful bounty of Chaos"</span>
        <span class="rylenor">"Those things I'd never even wish to know!"</span>
        <span class="fulgrim"> "There is still your potential that shines through
            Imagine the unfulfilled glories we'd see to!"</span>
        <span class="rylenor"> "That you'd still think I seek any glory
            Betrays the true blindness that has overcome you!</span>
    </p>

    <p><span class="rylenor">I recall the virtues I stood for
            I recall the struggles and the things that we have done!
            I will not be deterred from my vengeance
            I remember the lessons passed on to the Sons!
            I am one of </span>
        <span class="emperors_light">the Emperor's Children
            I am Rylanor, and I am the Ancient of Rites!
            So I reject you for now and for always!
            To strike you down, I have waited for a million nights!"</span>
    </p>

    <p>Inspired by the things I've heard
        I raise my voice and shout clearly and out of turn <span class="honor">"Rylanor deserves better than you, oh
            Primarch
            Rylanor deserves better than all of us!"</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="honor_in_death">With but a single shot
            The Raptorae is relieved of duty and released of his task
            I feel the virus rend me apart, with my honor intact
            As I'm enveloped by the encroaching flash</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="fulgrim_wounded">"Although this body of mine's still intact
            A part of my pride, I fear, will never come back"</span>
    </p>
